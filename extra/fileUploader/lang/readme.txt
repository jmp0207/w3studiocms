Since version 2.6 TFU can read external language files.
This makes it possible that you can easily translate TFU 
into you language.

The languages for english, german and spanish are NOT
used by TFU because this 3 languages are build into the
flash.
The language files for German and Spanish are only dummy's.

The English language file is a template you should use if
you want to translate TFU into your language.
simply copy the en.xml and use your language shortcat for
your file name e.g. fi.xml. Then translate the file and
make sure to store the file as UTF-8!
You can test your language file by adding ?lang=<your language>
to the flash - e.g. twg_flash_uploader.swf?lang=fi

For missing keys always the english value is used. Simply 
translate missing keys if you are able to do it ;).
Please sent fully translated language files back to 
tinywebgallery@mdempfle.de. I will include them to the 
next build. To get a fitting flag please send me an e-mail.

Status of the language files:
English:     2.7    100%
German:      2.7    100%
Spanish:     2.7    100%
Italian:     2.7    100%
Dutch:       2.7    99%

All others 2.6.1 ~ 95%

Have fun using TFU,
